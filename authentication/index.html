    <h2>integrity of artifacts</h2>
    <p>Most artifacts published by xANNA in the registry have associated
      checksums to insure that when downloaded or passed around, nothing has
      been altered. These checksums are easy to check (see below). Artifacts
      that already have integrated integrity and authentication information
      (e.g. PKI certificates) may not be signed directly by the xANNA registrar.</p>
    <h2>authenticity of artifacts</h2>
    <p>Artifacts that contain or represent the assignment of a name or number
      are signed by at least one xANNA registrar. The signature is a promise
      that the artifact is a proper part of the registry. It conforms to the
      assignment guidelines and should not be in conflict with other
      registrations. It has passed through the hands of a registrar.</p>
    <p>PKI root certificates are signed. Certificates issued from a CA root need
      only the signing embedded in the certificate chain.</p>
    <p>The signature is not a guarantee of quality or the absence of errors,
      although we try our best to insure quality prior to signature.</p>
    <p>Signed artifacts can not be changed. They can only be superseded by later
      versions or through deprecation/obsolescence/revocation. This process
      insures name and number allocations are never reused for some other
      purpose (which can create confusion and ambiguity).</p>
    <p>The use of altered copies of signed artifacts means that xANNA can not
      vouch for the lack of conflicts with other names and numbers.</p>
    <p>Checking the authenticity of artifacts is more complicated than checking
      integrity. Note that authenticity checking automatically verifies
      integrity. The procedure is covered below.</p>
    <p>Registrar public keys are provided on this repository in the <a href="xANNA_KEYS.txt">xANNA_KEYS</a>
      file. <em>However, obtaining them directly from here does not provide
        much security</em>. If you wish to obtain the keys through another
      channel, please contract the registrar.</p>

    <h2>procedures for verifying and authenticating artifacts</h2>
    <p>The procedures are modeled after those used by the <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache
        Software Foundation</a>; in particular those used for <a href="http://ant.apache.org/srcdownload.cgi#Verify%20Releases">Ant</a>
      and <a href="http://ant.apache.org/ivy/download.cgi#VerifyReleases">Ivy</a>.</p>
    <p>A published artifact (a file) has one or more message digests associated
      with it. The digest is contained in a file with a name derived from the
      name of the artifact and the message digest algorithm. These files are
      normally placed in the same directory.</p>
    <p>If the file is signed by a xANNA registrar, there will be an associated
      (detached) signature file with a name composed of the artifact file name
      and the ".asc" suffix.</p>
    <p>For example, consider a text file named <code>artifact.txt</code>.  One
      will find the following files:</p>
    <pre class="src">$ ls -g
total 32
-rw-r--r--  1 staff   44 Dec 25 16:10 artifact.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 staff  256 Dec 25 17:10 artifact.txt.asc
-rw-r--r--  1 staff   63 Dec 25 17:04 artifact.txt.md5
-rw-r--r--  1 staff  100 Dec 25 17:04 artifact.txt.sha256
$ </pre>
    <p>One can generate and view the saved message digests manually and compare
      them:</p>
    <pre class="src">$ gpg --print-md sha256 artifact.txt
artifact.txt: C03905FC DAB29751 3A620EC8 1ED46CA4 4DDB62D4 1CBBD83E B4A5A359
              2BE26A69
$ cat artifact.txt.sha256 
artifact.txt: C03905FC DAB29751 3A620EC8 1ED46CA4 4DDB62D4 1CBBD83E B4A5A359
              2BE26A69
$</pre>
    <p>This works in a similar manner for the MD5 digests.</p>
    <p>To authenticate (check the signature of the registrars), one must first
      have the registrars' public keys. These keys should be imported (merged)
      into a public keyring. Then, one can check the signatures. Continuing the
      example, after obtaining the xANNA registrar keys in a file named <a href="./xANNA_KEYS.txt">xANNA_KEYS.txt</a>,
      they are imported:</p>
    <pre class="src">$ gpg --import xANNA_KEYS.txt
gpg: key 55FB53736A5F408B: "Robert Hyerle (ranger6) () &lt;ranger6rob@gmail.com&gt;" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
$ </pre>
    <p>The note about "no ultimately trusted keys found" refers to the fact that
      the imported key is not verified by someone else that you have indicated
      as trusted. You will see a similar warning below when verifying the
      artifact. One trusts the xANNA Registrar key because you got it from a
      trusted source who you believe knows how to handle keys.</p>
    <p>Now, the xANNA signature on the MIB file can be checked:</p>
    <pre class="src">$ gpg --verify artifact.txt.asc 
gpg: assuming signed data in 'artifact.txt'
gpg: Signature made Tue Dec 25 17:10:46 2018 CET
gpg:                using DSA key 3EAA2DC11757400AEA2EA7C8CD97C16346FC2C5F
gpg:                issuer "ranger6rob@gmail.com"
gpg: Good signature from "Robert Hyerle (ranger6) () &lt;ranger6rob@gmail.com&gt;"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
